## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-app.git


## Navigate to the project directory:
cd user-management-app


## Install Dependencies
npm install
OR
yarn install

## Running the Project
npm start
OR
yarn start

## Assumptions

Mock Backend: The app uses https://reqres.in/ for fetching users and performing CRUD operations.

Data Persistence: Since the API is a mock service, user modifications (edit/delete) wonâ€™t persist on refresh.

Pagination: The Reqres API supports pagination, and the app dynamically adjusts to the total pages returned by the API.
